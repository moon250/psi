# ψ Psi 

Psi is my personnal, home-made search engine. It features :
- 🇬 Google search
- 🦆 Duckduckgo search
- 🚫 Website blacklisting
- 🔫 [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) (For example : "cute cats !g" redirects you to google while searching for cute cat pictures)
- 📊 Built-in "telemetry" (Statistics about which engine's links you clicked on the most, or which website you used the most)
- 🌗 Light (Atom One Light) and Dark (Tokyo Night) theme

> [!NOTE]  
> DuckDuckGo search seems to be currently way slower than Google's (~1s against ~.5s).
> You may disable completely DDG search by commenting the corresponding provider in the [SearchService](https://github.com/moon250/psi/blob/app/Services/Search/SearchService.php#L18)
